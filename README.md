# Brain Games

Brain Games is a set of five console games based on the principle of popular mobile brainâ€”boosting applications. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. 
Games:
* The definition of an even number.
* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
* Determining the largest common divisor.
* The progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Definition of a prime number.
